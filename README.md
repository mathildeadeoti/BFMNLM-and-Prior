# BFMNLM-and-Prior
This is the R code for application of Bayesian flexible multilevel nonlinear model with prior sensitivity analysis. 
This repository contains the R codes used to fit a standard and flexible multilevel nonlinear model to Epidemic especially the case of West African countries COVID-19 data (as application example), which is presented in the following work: Adéoti O. M., Diop A., Glèlè Kakaï R., (2025) Bayesian inference and impact of parameters prior specification in flexible multilevel nonlinear models in the context of infectious diseases modeling. Submitted. Preprint

To run the application, please follow instructions in file "Code_application_BFMNLM.R"
